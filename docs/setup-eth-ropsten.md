## Using Peggy with the Ropsten testnet

### Setup

Before you can use the Bridge with the Ropsten testnet, you'll need to add two environment variables to the configuration file at `testnet-contracts/.env`. Add `MNEMONIC` from your MetaMask account, this will allow you to deploy the contracts to the Ropsten testnet. Add `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` from your Infura account, this will allow you to start a Relayer service that listens for events on the Ropsten testnet.

### Deploy contracts to Ropsten testnet

```bash
# Deploy the contracts to the Ropsten network with the --network flag
yarn migrate --network ropsten

# Activate the contracts
yarn peggy:setup

# Copy contract ABI to Relayer it can subscribe to deployed contracts
yarn peggy:abi

# Get the Registry contract's address on the Ropsten network with the --network flag
yarn peggy:address --network ropsten
```

### Start the Relayer service on Ropsten testnet

```bash
ebrelayer init tcp://localhost:26657 wss://ropsten.infura.io/ [REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS] validator --chain-id=peggy
```

### Lock rEth on contracts

Send funds to the deployed contracts on the Ropsten testnet:   

```bash
yarn peggy:lock --network ropsten [COSMOS_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] eth [RWEI_AMOUNT]
```
